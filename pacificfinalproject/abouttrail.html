			<h3>Our History</h3>
			  <img src="aboutgallery/history.jpg"  alt="Black and white picture of yurts">
			<p><span class="pacific">Pacific Trails Resort</span> has welcomed guests in Zephyr for over 20 years. Entreprenuers John and Mary Williamson were inspired to open a yurt resort after traveling through Central Asia. In 1975, Pacific Trails Resort opened with only 10 yurts. Today, you can find over 80 luxury yurts with a beautiful ocean view.</p>
